                        <p class="song-description">The song revolves around the theme of the loneliness of being a rich kid, and the isolation being felt. The song starts off with a story "I start my day on the roof" and then it goes through the day of a rich kid and finally ends on "I end the day on the roof". The song is my number 1 song of all time due to the beats and the lyrical storytelling.</p>

                        <p class="song-description">The song ties in with the theme of Igor. It follows a story of Tyler trying to convince someone he loves to not abandon him. The song perfectly encapsulates Tyler's style of music and his entire vibe. It's abrasive and hard, especially in the beginning with loud screeching to start the song off. I love this song because it embraces who Tyler is completely.</p>

                        <p class="song-description">This is obviously a love story based on the cover and the lyrics. The song revolves around the feeling of being with someone through their hardship and arising from it. This is evident where he mentions "Whenever the sun doesn't shine on the westside" where it shows the hardship/darkness. The vocals of GoldLink and the chorus of Jessy Rose which echoes throughout the song makes it so addicting to me.</p>

                        <p class="song-description">This song is all about Drake. The song is about his emotions about breaking up with his ex Rihanna. In the song he talks about Rihanna and what he misses about her, and how he can't forget about everything about her. "I got my eyes on you / You're everything that I see / I want your hot love and emotion endlessly/ I can't get over you / You left your mark on me / I want your hot love and emotion endlessly." This showed that Rihanna had already left a mark on Drake. Overall this song is catchy especially at the part "I got my eyes on you", taking my number 4 spot.</p>

                        <p class="song-description">An absolutely wonderful single from SZA. It's catchy, with an emotional tone from SZA. The song explores living on another planet and escaping stagnation on Earth, however reaching Saturn is impossible. The song is like the message of "the grass is always greener on the other side". This means it is about dreaming and facing the reality of where you are right now rather than where you could be. The emotional impact of the song is incredible, since most people would find this relatable of trying to be somewhere else than now. This song tells you to embrace where you are and fight through.</p>

                        <p class="song-description">This is probably the most complex and weird song on my top 10 list. The song explores themes of transformation and an unsettling nature of change. The song tells a story about going through a physical metamorphosis with their arms and hands like the title suggested. As their hands and arm changes they reach new heights, and them being able to touch their toes suggest a new sense of control of their own body. This can also be interpreted as a trans person going through physical changes and becoming more comfortable of their own body. Overall this song's genre is hyper pop which makes the song super hyper and a joy to listen to even if its lyrically complex and weird.</p>

                        <p class="song-description">The central message of Crew is about money and fame, however it tells the listener to look behind the money and see the hardship the person faced in order to achieve the wealth they have. The story of Crew starts when the protagonist was just a boy and the sacrifices others made to get him to where he is today. Overall the song is GoldLink’s most popular song for a reason, with it being nominated for a Grammy for R&B.</p>

                        <p class="song-description">The Weekend has become a mainstream name adored by many by his emotionally filled voice. He tops the streaming chart on Spotify with hits such as "Blinding Lights" and "Starboy". However people often ignore his earlier works, and that is such a mistake cause his earlier songs are clearly what influenced his mega hits. House of Balloon is a lookback at the Weekend’s life before he became famous. The song shows us a place where he used to party with his friends back in Toronto and how he did drugs. Which is ironic since the theme of balloons often depict something special like a birthday, however for the Weekend it was partying and doing drugs, and he added balloons to make it more "celebratory". This song showcases the Weekend’s earlier works which you can tell influence his later more popular works. I think this song is super underrated which is why it earns the number 8th place on my list and my favorite song from him.</p>

                        <p class="song-description">I discovered this song recently even though it's been out for a while. I believe it exploded all over social media, and for good reason. The song comes from a relatively small indie pop artist, however the meaning behind the song is not small. Tek It is about relationships and how every relationship experiences hardship but all of them keep progressing. It takes off with discovering the person and becoming in love with them and how everything is so perfect, then it becomes an issue as crack begins to show. The title also means "take it" as the artist is reflecting on their own experiences of it happening, and how she had to bear the weight of the one sided relationship. I had this song on repeat during the summer due to similar experiences and it really became a song that I come back to.</p>

                        <p class="song-description">Frank Ocean's way of making you feel emotions in his song shouldn't be possible. This song is one of his best works and highly underrated. The song flips between rap and R&B which is something I usually don't like but in this case it works out great. The song explores the life of a dental woman (who is the cover) and her destructive habits in order to escape from the world. It talks about how she does sex work, drug, and materalism in order to escape her life. It also creates a theme of loneliness felt by the women and in general the song talks about the struggle people like her feel and how she wants to escape from the connectivity of the modern world. Overall this is a jarring song from Frank and explores uncomfortable and sensitive themes.</p>
